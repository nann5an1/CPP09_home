- each of the values must be less than 10(0 - 9)
- all computation expressions
- must end in one of the operators

"1 2 * 2 / 2 * 2 4 - +"

- check for number of arguments -> must be only 2


- split the input argument first
while(until the arugment is gone)
- push each into the stack (for the first 2 elements make sure it's consecutive)
- if another that is to be pushed into the stack is the operator, apply the operation on the stack's elements -> then update the result into the stack
